          <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like
            consistency is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on
            the inside. Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature
            throughout the frying process. This one, however, only starts at a
            very high heat â€” after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30
            minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in
            that crispy texture. Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke
            point, which helps with browning the chicken.

              <li>1 teaspoon Paprika</li>
              <li>2 quarts vegetable oil (for frying)</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken
                you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the
                flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to
                brown the chicken).
              </li>
              <li>
                Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them
                in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover
                with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR
                IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
              </li>
              <li>
                Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full
                with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
              </li>
              <li>
                Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the
                chicken in HOT oil on both sides.
              </li>
              <li>
                When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30
                minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).
                Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until
                crispy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much
                chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the
                finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the
                rest.
